# Graph and Graph Algorithm

## Graph Representations 

* **Adjacency Matrix** - 2D array

* **Adjacency List** - An array of linked lists

* **Object Oriented Representation** - [Python Implementation](https://github.com/Jason-Yuan/Interview-Code/blob/master/Graph%20and%20Graph%20Algorithm/Graph.py)

* **Implicit Representation** - vertex.neighbor could be a method (which can generate neighbors when needed)

# Basic Data Structures

### Here is the basic abstract data types(ADT)

##### 1. Linear Data Structures
Stacks, queues, deques, and lists are examples of data collections whose items are ordered depending on how they are added or removed.

We use build-in **Python List**(which is specifically unordered linked list) to inplement **Stack**, **ueue** and **Deque**
* [Stack](http://interactivepython.org/runestone/static/pythonds/BasicDS/TheStackAbstractDataType.html) (LIFO, Last In First Out)
* [Queue](http://interactivepython.org/runestone/static/pythonds/BasicDS/WhatIsaQueue.html) (FIFO, First In First Out)
* [Deque](http://interactivepython.org/runestone/static/pythonds/BasicDS/WhatIsaDeque.html) (Double-ended Queue)

We create a **NODE** class to implement linked list in Python, the difference between unordered LL and ordered LL is the implementation of the Add() method.
